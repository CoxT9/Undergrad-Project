% outline from meeting has section breakdown:
\section{Introduction}

\section{Related Work} % existing lit and particularly IACO - and its issues. Also need HOPNET for foundation

\section{Z-BAR} % how we will tackle the issues, give the algorithm

\section{Experimental Results} % exec over large scale data

\section{Conclusion} % what did we find?

\section{Future Work} % next...
