Notes on clustering problems and Ant Brood Clustering:

Clustering (Cluster Analysis) is the process of grouping objects into a sequence of clusters, categorizing by some similarity/ies. Clustering ties into Multi Criteria Analysis because there can be >1 criteria which define cluster membership, or the strength of cluster membership. The most popular classical clustering algorithm is K-means clustering:

- We try to optimize intra-cluster similarity, and optimize inter-cluster dissimilarity

"Partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype (model) of the cluster"

ABC (Ant Brood Clustering) is a clustering heuristic that mimicks how ants sort their breeding areas. This is also called Ant Brood Sorting, but it is not a "Sorting" algorithm (it is for Clustering). This behavior was first observed in 1991 by Franks and Sendova-Franks. Many different implementations of ABC exist in the literature. These implementations are generally geared to specific use-cases (ie: option pricing). 

Some questions in cluster formation include (Things to think about when working with ABC):
 - How many clusters are to be created?
 - Do clusters have a maximum size?
 - What is the criteria for cluster admittance, and how strict is the criteria?

Questions for Dr. Thulasiraman:

- What kinds of algs are we looking at?
- How do we measure performance?
- What is the performance vs K-means?
- What did the last student do for their approach?

An interesting application of ABC is VANET, which ties back into MAZACORNET. Question: Is data-clustering similar to VANET clustering?
Can ABC be used for cluster formation or *zone formation*? ie: Zones end up being geographically close agents with geographically close destinations.

ABC survey: http://www.ijcte.org/papers/242-G730.pdf

"The  probability  of  dropping  an  item  is increased  if  ants  are  surrounded  with  similar  data  in  the neighborhood"
"the probability of picking an item is increased if a data item is surrounded by dissimilar data, or when  there  is  no  data  in  its  neighborhood"

It may be possible to execute a clustering algorithm for vanet, but it would be A) centralized and B) robust to changes in graph state.

To start: look into what Ziyue Wang is up to for ABC. Read the linked ABC survey. 
Here is a clustering in VANET survey:

Need to think about whether clustering really does apply to VANET
