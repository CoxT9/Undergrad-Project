Overview for COMP 4520

1. VANET

- Basics & Terminology
- Decouple Packet Transmission and Route Planning
- Traffic sensitivty in route planning
- Graph theory analogies (k-connectivity, weights, flow & capacity)
- Existing approaches ie: Dijkstra-Recompute

2. ACO

- Basics & Terminology
- Application and usage
- Usage in VANET -> Route planning
- Usage for Traffic Sensitivity, examine MACO
- Propose an algorithm or strategy

3. Simulate

- Basic SUMO
- Routes in SUMO
- Simple routes on Larger datasets
- Dijkstras on SUMO
- Dynamic weights in SUMO
- Dijkstra-Recompute
- Weights as a function of vehicles present
- Simple ACO
- Reverse-ACO
- Reverse-ACO with recompute shortest path
- Performance comparison
