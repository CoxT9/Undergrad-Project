This is a repository I set up for tracking the work for COMP 4520, Summer 2017.
This repo includes nodes, code, other files, and all deliverables.

The results of this work were (1) a project report detailing the problem space of traffic assignment and (2) a peer-reviewed publication proposing a new algorithm for addressing the specific problem of scalability in traffic assignment.
